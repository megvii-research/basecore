class BaseTrainer:
    """
    Base class for epoch-wise trainer with hooks.

    Design of BaseTrainer is inspired by hook in detectron2, see more information on
    https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/detectron2/engine/train_loop.py

    The only assumption we made here is: the training runs in a loop.
    A subclass can implement what the loop is.
    We made no assumptions about the existence of dataloader, optimizer, model, etc.

    Attributes:
        model: model used for training process.
        solver: solver used for training process. For megengine user,
            it contains optimzer and grad_manager at least.
        dataloader: data provider for training process.
        progress: object used for recording trainging processing.
